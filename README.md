This project focuses on generating extractive summaries of legal documents using rhetorical role classification as guidance. Legal documents are typically structured into various rhetorical components such as facts, arguments, precedents, statutes, and more. To exploit this structure, the summarization approach is built in two main stages.
First, each sentence in a legal document is classified into a rhetorical role using a model composed of InLegalBERT integrated with a BiLSTM and CRF layer. This setup captures contextual dependencies and sequential labeling patterns effectively. Once rhetorical roles are assigned, each sentence is further evaluated for its importance in the summary using a binary sentence classification model built on InLegalBERT with a classifier head. This model assigns a label of 1 for summary-worthy sentences and 0 otherwise.
The overall pipeline begins with sentence segmentation from raw documents, followed by rhetorical role classification and summary label prediction. Sentences labeled with 1 are then grouped under their respective rhetorical roles, and the final structured extractive summary is compiled by preserving these groupings. This approach ensures that the summary retains the logical and legal argument structure of the original document, making it both concise and contextually rich.
